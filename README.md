# *SurvDC* R Package
An R package for estimating survival function under dependent censoring.
- adopt copula-based approaches
- without the consideration of covariates
- impose fully parametric margins or let one of the margins to be nonparametric
- with or without the existence of a cured fraction
- In summary, we consider the following cases:
  - fully-parametric margins (without cure)
  - fully-parametric margins (with cure in survival time)
  - nonparametric survival margin and parametric censoring margin (without cure)
  - nonparametric survival margin and parametric censoring margin (with cure in survival time)
  - parametric survival margin and nonparametric censoring margin (without cure)
  - parametric survival margin and nonparametric censoring margin (with cure in survival time)

For details are on the way ... Thank you for your attention!
